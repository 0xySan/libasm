# libasm

## Project :

The libasm Project is to re-create the most famous C function from the libft we did at the start of our 42Cursus.
The difference being we have to do it using the most primitive and low-level language : **Assembly language** !

## Functions :

The functions I re-coded in Assembly is the following :

- ft_strlen
- ft_strcmp
- ft_strdup
- ft_strcpy
- ft_read
- ft_write


This project is a W.I.P
